#+title: Processes
#+author: Ethan Coe-Renner

an operating system executes a variety of programs
- batch system (i.e. supercomputer): jobs
- time shared systems (i.e. laptop): user programs or tasks

* Process: a program in execution
includes:
- program counter
  points to the instruction to be executed, in the binary file
- stack
- data section

* Process Stateful
as a new process executes, it changes statae
- new: process being created
- running: instructions are being executed
- waiting: process is waiting for some event to occur
- ready: process is waiting to be assigned to a processor
- terminated: the process has finished execution

* Process representation in linux
represented by c structure task_struct
t
  
* Scheduling
** long term scheduler
which process should be brought into ready queue

invoked infrequently, may be slow

** short term scheduler
selects which process should be executed next and allocates cpu

invoked very frequently, must be fast
* Process creation
parent processes create children processes, form tree of processes

resource sharing options
1. parent and child share resources
2. children share subset of parents resources
3. parent and child share no resources
