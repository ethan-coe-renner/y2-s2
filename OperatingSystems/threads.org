* Motivation

threads run within an application

multiple tasks can be implemented by seperate threads

process creation is heavy-weight, while thread creation is light-weight.

a process can contain multiple threads, they share the same address space
seperate registers and stack

** benefits
- responsiveness
- resource sharing
- economy
- scarcity

servers use threads to service each request

three primary user thread libraries: pthreads, win threads, java threads

* multithreading models
** many to one
many user level threads mapped to a single kernal thread

multiple threads are unable to run in parallel on multiprocessors.
