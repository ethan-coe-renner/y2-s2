#+title: COMP 141 CA 4

* Semantic Safety in C++ vs Java
1. Prints out ~3\n0~
2. Prints out ~3\n~ then gives an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. 
3. Java is safer because it warns the user that they are accessing an inaccesible array index, while cpp just accesses the memory, even though it hasn't been allocated.
* Extensions
1. Python seems to have a new major version about every year, a trend since 2018.
2. Java gets a new major release every few years, the last few were in 2014, 2017, and 2018
3. Haskell has not had a major update since 2010, 12 years after the previous update in 1998.
4. ML has frequent patch releases (3 in 2021), but has not had a major release since prior to 2003p.
