#+title: Ambiguous Grammers
#+author: Ethan Coe-Renner

A grammer is ambiguous if there are two distinct parse trees for a given sentence.

Ambiguity is a problem because it implies different precedence and different associativity properties for operators.

right associativity: 3 + (4+5)
left associativity: (3+4)+5
