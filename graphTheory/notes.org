#+title: Graph Theory Notes

consider two sequences (1) S, t_1, t_2, ...,t_s, d_1, ..., d_n and (2) t_1-1, t_2-1,..., t_s-1, d_1,...,d_n

(1) is graphic iff (2) is graphic

* Isomorphic
two graphs G_1 and G_2 are isomorphic if the vertices of G_1 and G_2 can be labeled with the numbers 1 to p (same number of vertices) such that whenever vertex i is adjacent to vertex j in G_1 then they are adjacent in G_2 and conversely.

list out edges in the graphs and confirm that the lists are the same

have the same subgraphs

* Complete Graph
every vertice is adjacent to every other vertice.

with n vertices the graph will have $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ edges


* Paths
each vertex has two edges, linking the vertices in a chain

* Cycles
path where last vertex connects back to first

* Subgraph
subgraph of G consists of a subset of vertices of G and a subset of edges of G

edges must connect vertices

every graph is a subgraph of itself
